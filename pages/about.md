## About CAPWA UP

Welcome to Community Animals Partners and Welfare Advocates (CAPWA) UP, the online platform dedicated to cat adoption at the University of the Philippines Diliman! We are passionate and dedicated advocates of animal welfare who have come together to make a difference in the lives of our campus friends at UP Diliman.

At CAPWA UP, we lead and implement quality programs and projects within the University of the Philippines Diliman community that will improve the well-being of campus animals and foster an attitude of compassion and responsibility towards them. Aside from adoption, we implement Grand Kapon (for cats healthy enough to undergo the procedure), and Grand Pakaian for all the campus animals in all UP Diliman college units.

We strive to embody compassion and social responsibility by serving as a channel for community involvement in developing harmonious relationships between humans and animals in the University of the Philippines Diliman community. We aim to achieve this vision through education, advocacy in action, and a focus on animal welfare and humane animal management.

Our organization is committed to ensuring the welfare of each cat before and after spaying and neutering until they are adopted. We prioritize their health by subjecting them to a comprehensive evaluation and conducting a CBC (Complete Blood Count) to assess their overall well-being and suitability for adoption. Additionally, we actively promote responsible pet ownership and population control. To contribute to the well-being of cats and prevent unplanned litters, all cats available for adoption through CAPWA UP have been castrated.

CAPWA UP offers a centralized platform where you can explore profiles of the cats available for adoption. Each profile provides information such as the cat's name, age, color, personality traits, and location. Our aim is to provide transparency and assist you in finding a feline companion that suits your lifestyle and preferences.

Whether you're a student, faculty member, or staff at UP Diliman, we encourage you to explore our website and consider opening your heart and home to a furry companion. By adopting a cat, you not only gain a lifelong friend but also contribute to reducing the stray cat population and promoting a compassionate community.

Thank you for visiting CAPWA UP, and together, let's make a positive impact on the lives of cats in need.
